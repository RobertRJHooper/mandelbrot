Next todo:
Move up files from public_html

Features to make:

maybes:

maybe nots:
limits to size of caches - clear points two screens away from center panel
add memory check when creating panels and warn about it
restrict cpu usage by mem
add more bulbs
allow click to fix sampler point
add cross to sampler point and make the first point blue
sampler will breakdown at high zoom as canvas coordinates overflow - fix
allow canvas width and height to be specified or set to auto
javascript modules - how to with comments
github releases mechanism for continous deployment
convert numbered points to html elements so they zoom properly
time limiting
set focus on main div (away from nav bar etc on home click, box selection, sample mode)
add firefox prefixes webkit to css

done:
reform functions comments
test in safari, firefox
toBigInt crashes for 1e21 plus as strings are writen in scientific notation
make stats accurate with multiple workers
add scroll wheel zoom - using a library?
make a info display area that appears on touches or mouse movement
add stats to info panel
add iterations counter on main display
move artithmetic for mb formulas out of artithmetic
get libraries local copy for speed
trace stick on click
add tooltips to buttons
brower url change should trigger reread of url parameterisation
complete sampler draw
look at panning - is it debounced enough in the workers
reset should not update the precision
add precision to url and feed precision through ui using strings for numbers
move precision calculations all to the model client
high precision numbers
make local copies
put imaningary numbers to an object when not speed sensitive
image deltas - panning and zooming - by mouse, touch
throttle animation frame to 5fps?
icons: change selector to join the dots icon, add box selector icon for mouse zooming
use requestframe to handle throttling so the calculation pauses in the background and drawing is paced with the callback
move model client code to it's own file
put worker code in a ModelClient class
post only updated frames to master in worker
link canvas size in app to set
change parameterisation of view to center point and resolution
in place complex iteration and other calculations

url anchoring to center and resolution
iterations limiting with idling
use memoization to improve performance of viewBox parsing
box only on left click
dont let sampler tooltip move out of the app frame
add modal wikipedia page
convergeance trace on mouse over
info overlay
fix click positioning with the box
initial box to object-fit transformation on window
zoom box - allow any size and then cover transfor the viewbox

notes:
software implementation planning: survey available libraries to minimise reinventing the wheel.
